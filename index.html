            <p><i>pura 2023</i></p>
            <p> The only thing we did in 2023 was kalesh saal ke pehle din we spoke for 3 hours long fir uske baad downfall . Feb March Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct aise gaye jese hum dono ek dusre dushmaan hai . You hurted me once in Aug jo mai abhi bhi bhula nhi hu aur bhulunga nhi. Nov mai thing got a bit sorted and fir before going to bangkok we had call which was refreshing coz itne drama ke baad we had normal conversation . Well also this saal was my placement saal also i had to manage placements and our detoriorating bond . It was a tough job but i did it *fair enough ig* . The only thing which still hurts is why you always talk about breaking things than of healing or finding solutions. This kind of you approach toward our bond made me question that are you even serious with the bond or just keeping it just for sake of keeping it. I understand you are young but yaar tumhara tareeka mujhe acha nhi laga tha . Tum bohot aache insaan ho no doubt but just ki tumhe chize samhalni nhi aati. Meri bhi galti thi i know ki menai tumhare sweetness ko hints samjh liya but anyways learnt it a hardway. We ended 2023 on a sweet end , hehe. </p>
